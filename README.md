# Fomantic.Blazor
Fomantic-UI is a community fork of Semantic-UI. This project is a wrapper around Fomantic-UI/Semantic-UI for the new Blazor framework in .NET Core 3.x.

#Current demo
The current demo is feature incomplete and still got some bugs - but it is non the less working and I already use it for another project. This is a server-side demo of the Fomantic-Blazor framework:  https://92.204.49.117/
